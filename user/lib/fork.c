/* Overview:
 *   Grant our child 'envid' access to the virtual page 'vpn' (with address 'vpn' * 'BY2PG') in our
 *   (current env's) address space.
 *   'PTE_COW' should be used to isolate the modifications on unshared memory from a parent and its
 *   children.
 *
 * Post-Condition:
 *   If the virtual page 'vpn' has 'PTE_D' and doesn't has 'PTE_LIBRARY', both our original virtual
 *   page and 'envid''s newly-mapped virtual page should be marked 'PTE_COW' and without 'PTE_D',
 *   while the other permission bits are kept.
 *
 *   If not, the newly-mapped virtual page in 'envid' should have the exact same permission as our
 *   original virtual page.
 *
 * Hint:
 *   - 'PTE_LIBRARY' indicates that the page should be shared among a parent and its children.
 *   - A page with 'PTE_LIBRARY' may have 'PTE_D' at the same time, you should handle it correctly.
 *   - You can pass '0' as an 'envid' in arguments of 'syscall_*' to indicate current env because
 *     kernel 'envid2env' converts '0' to 'curenv').
 *   - You should use 'syscall_mem_map', the user space wrapper around 'msyscall' to invoke
 *     'sys_mem_map' in kernel.
